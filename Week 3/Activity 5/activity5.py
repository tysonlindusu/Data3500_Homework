Programming Activity 5

Update the function in activity one, and create a new string variable in the function called, welcome_message. The variable welcome_message should be 
assigned the value "Welcome " name. The same value printed in activity 1, but here you save it as a variable. Return the variable welcome_message.
- Assuming your function in programming activity 1 works, you will need to:
- Create a variable to store "Welcome " + name
- Return the value welcome_message
- There are a couple ways to test this. you could
         1. Print(welcome_fctn("Bob"))
         2. Create a variable to store what is returned by the function then print that
"""
name = "Bob"
welcome_message = "Welcome " + name

greeting = welcome_message + name

def welcome_fctn(message):
    return message

print(welcome_fctn(welcome_message))
