Programming Activity 4

Write a function named "welcome_fctn" which takes one argument, called "name".  Inside the function, print to the console "Welcome " name.
- Use the def command to define a function "welcome_fctn"
- Add a parameter list with one variable "name", i.e. (name)
- Print "Welcome " name in the function body.
- We don't need a return statement here, but keep in mind python does return nothing.
- Call the function, welcome_fctn(<your_name>)
